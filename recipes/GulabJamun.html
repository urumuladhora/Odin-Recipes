<h4> Steps </h4>
<ol class="list">
    <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil.
        <br> Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. 
            <br>Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together.
             <br>Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.</li>
             <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                <br> Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough.
                <br>  When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
                <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.
                    <br> Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.</li>
                    <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. 
                        <br>Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
